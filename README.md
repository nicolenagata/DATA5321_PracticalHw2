# Analysis on Diabetes Diagnosis
**DATA5321_PracticalHw2**

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project explores the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to predict the presence of a diabetes diagnosis based on an individuals' demographics, dietary, socio-economic, and health behaviors. The data comes from the **National Health Interview Survey**, accessed via **IPUMS Health Survey**.

---

## Goals

- Apply SVM models (linear, radial, and polynomial kernels) to classify a diabetes diagnosis.
- Investigate the relationships among at least 5 different variables (dietary, body composition/ health, socio-economic).
- Analyze factors that impact adults having a diabetes diagnosis.


**Objective:**  
Investigate factors correlated with adult (over the age of 45) diabetes diagnosis and provide insights that could inform diabetes educational programs.
